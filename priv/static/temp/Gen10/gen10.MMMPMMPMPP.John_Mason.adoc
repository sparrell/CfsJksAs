notes: PEQUOT WAR - In May 1637, the Connecticut General court declared an " offensive war" against the Pequot Indians. Command of the Connecticut forces was entrusted to Captain John Mason, a tall, portly, 
----
2 CONC vigorous soldier, thirty seven years of age. Mason was a veteran of the continental wars, having served during the past decade with the English expeditionary forces as a lieutenant under Sir Thomas Fa
2 CONC irfax in the Netherlands. Before migrating to Connecticut from the Bay colony, Mason had represented Dorchester in the General Court for two years and had assisted in the planning of the fortification
2 CONC s at Boston, Charlestown and Castle Island. On May 25th the English forces under Mason and guided by Uncas and his Mohicans surrounded the Pequot Village at Mystic. They attacked the palisaded village
2 CONC , setting the lodges on fire and massacring the inhabitants as they tried to escape. Two colonial soldiers were killed and seventy-seven wounded, some severely. <p></p> <p>Late in 1638, a band of Pequ
2 CONC ots reestablished a village at Pawcatuck near the Rhode Island border. Captain Mason and forty Connecticut sodiers, aided by Uncas and 100 Mohicans sailed to Pawcatuck Bay.Mason and his men proceeded 
2 CONC to loot and burn the Pequot village to the beat of a drum. Captured Pequots were turned over to the Mohicans.
