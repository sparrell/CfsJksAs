2 CONC the Pachaug river, east of Appaquashosk hill. They had experienced to the full the savagery of the Indians, for their only son, a lad of 12 years, also named Samuel, had just before been kidnapped  an
2 CONC d carried into captivity by the redskins, with whomhe remained for nearly 2 years. It chanced  that during this time he was brought into the company of Hannah Dustin and Mary Neff, the detailsof whose
2 CONC  capture by the Indians at Haverhill, Mass., in 1697, had horrified all New England. The three,while in a wigwam occupied by 2 Indian families on an island in the Merrimac river, near Concord, planned
2 CONC  theirescape. The boy Samuel had been so long with the savages that, whenhe asked his master how to strike to kill instantly, and how to take ascalp, it was taken as a sign that he had become one of t
2 CONC hem, and he was freely told. When the  captives had perfected their plans, silently and with speed, while thier captors slept, the attack was made. Ten Indians were killed instantly; the two remaining
2 CONC , a squaw who was wounded, and achild who was spared purposely, escaped to the woods. With thescalps ofthe slain and their weapons, the three, captives no longer, embarked ina canoe, and having scuttl
2 CONC ed the boats that remained, descendedthe river until the came in safety to their friends. The news of theirescape spread from settlement to settlement, and all who heard were filled withastonishment a
2 CONC nd admiration because of their heroic deed. Soon after theboy Samuel returned, doubtless fearing then and always the vengeanceofhis implacable foes, the family fled in secrecy to Pachaug,and becameper
2 CONC manent settlers there. Family tradition alone tells us that at one timein the early days the Leonards became aware of an Indian lurkingabout their home. At last, after days of watching, a member of th
2 CONC e family shoot the Indian dead, seemingly with no more compunction than he would have shown toward a dangerous beast. But such incidents were exceptional. <p></p>
