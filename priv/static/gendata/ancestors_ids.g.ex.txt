    notes: ["<p></p> <p>Peter Collamore settled at Wills Island in the marshes on the Scituate side of the North River before 1643. In 1650 he purchased a farm from Edward Foster on the adjacent mainland (The Coll\r\n2 CONC amore farm site consistedof 20 acres of upland roughly bounded by  the present Route 3A on the west, the Driftway to the north and the North River marshes to the east and south together with 12 acres \r\n2 CONC of adjoining marsh. Being childless, Peter wrote to his brother in Northam, Devon with a request that one of his nephews come to New England to be his heir. In 1665, Anthony Collamore accepted the inv\r\n2 CONC itation andcame to live with his uncle. Peter died in 1684 and left his estate including the sloop Mayflower  and the farm to Anthony, as promised. <p></p> <p>In 1666 Anthony Collamore married Sarah C\r\n2 CONC hittenden and over the following 13 years, they had one son and four daughters. Anthony was active inthe Scituate militia company, rising through the ranks to Lieutenant in1686 and Captain in 1692. <p\r\n2 CONC ></p> <p>On December 15, 1693, Anthony Collamore loaded his sloop at Hobart?s Landing  with a cargo of firewood for the Boston market. He sailed down the North river as soon as the tide started to ebb\r\n2 CONC  in orderto take advantage of the current and to cross the bar at the old mouth without grounding. He then entered Scituate harbor  and anchored for the night. Thefollowing morning five passengers for\r\n2 CONC  Boston boarded the sloop - two men, a woman and two \"lads\". The day was overcast with a raw wind from thenorth-northeast. However, the weather did not seem unduly threateningand several vessels inclu\r\n2 CONC ding Collamore?s sloop put to sea as the tidestarted to ebb. <p></p> <p>Collamore's vessel was noted by several observers as it sailed north along the Scituate coast over the next hour. During that ti\r\n2 CONC me, a storm was rapidly developing and Collamore's sloop finally disappeared from view in a blizzard of wind-driven snow. Before dark of that same day, billets of cordwood and wreckage from a vessel b\r\n2 CONC egan coming ashore on NorthScituate beach. On the following day, the body of Ephraim Turner, aged26, came ashore on the beach. Fourteen days later, the body of AnthonyCollamore came ashore so badly ba\r\n2 CONC ttered that identification could onlybe made from his clothing. Collamore?s body was escorted to the old church on Meetinghouse Lane by the militia company under arms and he was buriedbeside the churc\r\n2 CONC h. No other bodies were ever recovered. <p></p> <p>From the pattern of the wreckage and cargo on North Scituate beach and the rapidity with which it came ashore, it was apparent that the sloop had bee\r\n2 CONC n driven on a ledge just offshore. That ledge has been identifiedon marine charts ever since as \"Collamore's Ledge\". <p></p> <p>A monument which includes the original slate headstone was later erected\r\n2 CONC  in the Old Meeting House Cemetary by Anthony's descendants.</p> <p></p> <p>Ancestor of Presidents William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison.</p>"],

Cyril lived in Uncasville and Ida's father had retired from the railroad and moved back there into Ida's grandmother's house. Cyril an\r\n2 CONC d Ida built property on the west side of the Norwich-New London Road just North of the Waterford-Montville line. They built a house and started a chicken farm, raising White Leghorn hens to provide wh\r\n2 CONC ite eggs. (White eggs found a ready market among the New Yorkers who were moving into Connecticut. Native New Englanders produced and used only brown eggs.) <p></p> <p>The poultry business was a succe\r\n2 CONC ss, but Cyril was not well and and diedin the 1920's. Ida ran the farm alone until about 1940. She was in her60's and the work got too hard for her. She went to work atConecticutCollege as a salad pre\r\n2 CONC parer in the dining room. Sometime in the 50's she retired from that. After an accident in which she demolished her car, Marion convinced her to sell her home.

    notes: ["<p>He early showed a decided taste for military affairs, and soon became amember of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, and was its captain from 1650 to 1658.  In 1644, he organized the first\r\n2 CONC  train-band in Dorchester. Later on he commanded the Suffolk regiment with the title of Major-General, and was the chief military officer in New England.  Formany years he served as selectman and town\r\n2 CONC  treasurer, and in 1638 and 1641, was Deputy to the General Court. <p></p> <p>Uncas, the Mohegan Sachem, after 1637 claimed vast territory in the vicinity of Norwich CT as a result of his assistance t\r\n2 CONC o the English in the Pequot War. Major General Humphrey Atherton was sent there by the United Colonies with 40 men to protect Uncas in his person and property. ThereMantinomo, Sachem of the Narraganse\r\n2 CONC tt Indians, was forced to sign a treaty with the United Colonies and to pay 2000 fathoms of white wampum damages and to leave hostages (children) with the United Colonies. When the damages claimed wer\r\n2 CONC e not paid, Atherton with twenty men marched to the wigwam of Pessacus, the Narragansett Sachem, and seizing him by the hair of the head drew him from the midst of his attendants, declaring that if th\r\n2 CONC ey should make the least resistance he would dispatch him in an instant. Therupon Pessacus was so alarmed that he paid all his damages.Atherton's demands for large sums of wampum appeared to have led \r\n2 CONC to the organization of the so-called \"Atherton Company\".  On 11 June and4 July1659, he and his \"Partners\" in the Atherton Company acquired from theIndian sachems large grants of land, situated west of\r\n2 CONC  Narragansett Bay, and these grants were confirmed 14 June 1660. <p></p> <p>In 1645 the Commissioners of the United Colonies appointed a Council ofWar, which was composed of Captain Standish of Plymou\r\n2 CONC th, Mason of Connecticut, and Leverett and Atherton of Massachusetts.</p> <p></p> <p>On 16 September 1661, Atherton was returning from a military review on Boston Common when his horse stumbled over a\r\n2 CONC  cow and he was fatally injured.</p> <p></p> <p>Johnson gives him good character; but Hubbard excites our suspicion that everybody did not value him so highly, when he remarks that by some the manner \r\n2 CONC of his death was noted as a judgement.</p> <p></p>"],

    notes: ["JAMES NEWTON SPARRELL I and RUTH VINAL SPARRELL <p></p> <p>JAMES NEWTON SPARRELL I - Family tradition (in italics):  James came from London. His father was an English mariner and his mother was a Fren\r\n2 CONC ch Huguenot. James and a brother came first to the Carolinas. James met Ruth Vinal on a voyage north, married her and settled in Scituate. James was a short, stocky, man of dark complexion. ( I have s\r\n2 CONC earched the Church of England Parish Records which generallybegin about 1600 and which have been collected and published by the Mormons. The only records of the Sparrell name occur in the area below t\r\n2 CONC he Tower of London in what is now known as the Docklands or East End of London. For example, Millicent Sparrell, child of James and Elizabeth Sparrell was christened at St. Mary?s Whitechapel on 21 Ja\r\n2 CONC n 1634. There are numerous records of the Sparrell family in the records of St. Mary?s Whitechapel and St. Dunstan?s Stepney, but I cannot find a record of our particular James. However, the area belo\r\n2 CONC w the Tower was the port of London for 500 years and washome to many English mariners and French Protestant refugees duringthe 17th and18th centuries. If  James? parents were married in a French Calvi\r\n2 CONC nist Church their marriage and James? baptism would not be found inthe Church of England  records -C.F.S.). <p></p> <p>James and Ruth Vinal were married  January 10, 1767 in the First ParishMeeting Ho\r\n2 CONC use in Scituate.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1771, James purchased a small cape cod cottage fronting on Scituate harbor at the present corner of  Beaver Dam Road and Front Street. The house was torn down 100 ye\r\n2 CONC ars later.</p> <p></p> <p>April 28, 1770, Captain Sparrell cleared the Boston Custom House outbound for Nova Scotia.</p> <p></p> <p>January 1, 1774, Captain Sparrell cleared the Boston Custom House in\r\n2 CONC bound from Philadelphia.</p> <p></p> <p>(The problem here is which calendar is being used, Old Style or New Style)</p> <p></p> <p>Since his estate was inventoried in January 26, 1774, James presumably\r\n2 CONC  died without time to settle his affairs in January 1774. The inventory suggests that he was master of the schooner Hannah, named for his daughter, that he made his own barrels and that he was engaged\r\n2 CONC  in fishing and trading. The list of debts submitted by Ruth Sparrell to the probate court, indicates that he was deeply in debt and left her in dire straits with three small children and no assets. <\r\n2 CONC p></p> <p>Samuel Deane (History of Scituate, 1831) reports that in 1770 upwards of 30 vessels out of Scituate harbor were engaged in the mackerel fisheries. He further states that by 1828 there were 3\r\n2 CONC 5 vessels of from 50 to150 tons carrying six to 15 hands. More than 15,000 barrels of mackerelwere taken in 1828. He also states that in winter these vessels were employed in the coastal trade carryin\r\n2 CONC g fish south and returning with plantation products. <p></p> <p>Salt mackerel packed in barrels of brine was purchased by planters as acheap source of protein to feed their slaves. Prior to the Revolu\r\n2 CONC tion,the Scituate sea captains traded lumber and salt mackerel for sugar and molasses in the British West Indies and salt mackerel for flour, tobacco, rice and indigo in the Carolinas and Georgia. <p>\r\n2 CONC </p> <p>RUTH VINAL SPARRELL - Ruth Vinal was born 23 April 1746, the daughter of John Vinal, Jr., A farmer in North Scituate, and his wife, Mary Stetson Vinal. Shortly after their marriage, Ruth and J\r\n2 CONC ames sold two acres of salt marsh on the Gulph River which she had inherited in the divisionof her father?s estate. Since she signed the deed with an X, she was illiterate which was not unusual for wo\r\n2 CONC men prior to 1800. <p></p> <p>Ruth and James had three children: Elizabeth (2 September 1767), James Newton (7 April 1770) and (Hannah 18 June 1772). Only James survived to adulthood.</p> <p></p> <p>C\r\n2 CONC aptain James?s inventory suggests the multitude of tasks that Ruth hadto tend to in addition to the care of three small child" <> ...],

Mason was a veteran of the continental wars, having served during the past decade with the English expeditionary forces as a lieutenant under Sir Thomas Fa\r\n2 CONC irfax in the Netherlands. Before migrating to Connecticut from the Bay colony, Mason had represented Dorchester in the General Court for two years and had assisted in the planning of the fortification\r\n2 CONC s at Boston, Charlestown and Castle Island. On May 25th the English forces under Mason and guided by Uncas and his Mohicans surrounded the Pequot Village at Mystic. They attacked the palisaded village\r\n2 CONC , setting the lodges on fire and massacring the inhabitants as they tried to escape. Two colonial soldiers were killed and seventy-seven wounded, some severely. <p></p> <p>Late in 1638, a band of Pequ\r\n2 CONC ots reestablished a village at Pawcatuck near the Rhode Island border. Captain Mason and forty Connecticut sodiers, aided by Uncas and 100 Mohicans sailed to Pawcatuck Bay.Mason and his men proceeded \r\n2 CONC to loot and burn the Pequot village to the beat of a drum.

The family appears to have moved from Ll\r\n2 CONC andaff</p> <p>to Bristol, England on the opposite side of the Bristol Channel, a short</p> <p>time at least, perhaps a few years, prior to 1636. The name of his father</p> <p>is unknown, but there is \r\n2 CONC some traditionary evidence that it was William.</p> <p>(In another part of this Genealogy it gives the following information on</p> <p>William:</p> <p>There is a tradition that this William used to sa\r\n2 CONC y that his father, John,</p> <p>had a very old, little book, in which was written the name of \"William</p> <p>Morgan, of Llandaff\", (Wales) and dated before A.D. 1600, who he said</p> <p>was the fathe\r\n2 CONC r of our first James, the emigrant. There are other</p> <p>circumstances which strengthen the probabilities of this tradition. This</p> <p>William had a pair of gold sleeve buttons of antique make, an\r\n2 CONC d having</p> <p>\"WM.\" rudely but plainly stamped on each, which are said to have come</p> <p>down as an \"Heirloom\" from William A. (#375), and were long held by me</p> <p>as a precious relic, until st\r\n2 CONC olen a few years ago. By great effort I</p> <p>discovered a trace of them soon after, but all too late to save them from</p> <p>the crucible of an innocent purchaser, by whom they had been melted</p> \r\n2 CONC <p>with a common mass of old jewelery.)</p> <p>That year, 1636, in the month of March, he and two younger brothers,</p> <p>John and Miles, sailed from Bristol and arrived in Boston, Mass. in April</p>\r\n2 CONC  <p>following. John Morgan, his next younger brother, who from tradition</p> <p>appears to have been a high churchman and to have exceedingly disliked</p> <p>the austerity of the Puritans, left Boston\r\n2 CONC  in disgust for more congenial</p> <p>society in Virginia, soon after their arrival. How far the Morgans of</p> <p>Virginia are descended from him I am unable to say. Miles Morgan, the</p> <p>youngest\r\n2 CONC  brother, born in 1615, on his arrival at Boston, or soon after,</p> <p>joined a party of emigrants, mostly from Roxbury, of whom Col. Wm.</p> <p>Pyncheon was at the head, and founded the settlement o\r\n2 CONC f Springfield,</p> <p>Mass.</p> <p></p>\r\n2 SOUR @S17@\r\n3 QUAY 0"],

The Hurlburt par\r\n2 CONC ty included his wife, her female servant and ten other males. <p></p> <p>Gardiner was under contract to build a fort at the mouth of the Connecticut to keep the Dutch out of the river. Meanwhile, the \r\n2 CONC Pequot war was developing.</p> <p>On February 22,1637, Gardiner took ten men a half-mile from the fort toclear weeds and reeds where the Indians might hide. They were attackedby Indians who were hidin\r\n2 CONC g in the burning reeds. Two men threw down their matchlocks and ran away. Three including Hurlburt and Gardiner werewounded and two were killed by arrows. Hurlburt was shot almost through the thigh. A\r\n2 CONC fter firing their muskets they drew their swords and fought their way hand to hand back to the fort. <p></p> <p>During the siege of Saybrook fort, Hurlburt forged sharp iron points  which pierced the \r\n2 CONC moccasins of the Pequots when they tried to sneak up on the fort at night.</p> <p></p> <p>Hurlburt received a land grant in Wethersfield for service in the Pequot War and settled there. He was active \r\n2 CONC in the militia and served in thelegislature.</p>"],

It is mentioned in the town records of Windsor, Volume 1, that on February 2, 1640 he had granted him from the plantation 21 acres\r\n2 CONC  adjoining Farmington River,onthe west side of the Connecticut River.  This 21 acres included the site of the first English settlement in Connecticut.  Also granted him were several large tracts of la\r\n2 CONC nd on the east side of the Connecticut River, received partly from the town and partly by purchase. <p>He therefore probably came to Windsor in the summer or autumn of 1639.  He is generally supposed \r\n2 CONC to have come in the company with the Rev. Ephraim Huet, who arrived at Windsor on August 17, 1639.  He brought with him five sons, all of whom were freemen, October 7, 1669, and three daughters.  His \r\n2 CONC house was situated near the mouth of the Farmington River on\"The Island\", so called because at every great freshet it became temporarily an island by the overflowing of the Connecticut River. <p></p> \r\n2 CONC <p>Ancestor of President Millard Fillmore.</p>"],

They had experienced to the full the savagery of the Indians, for their only son, a lad of 12 years, also named Samuel, had just \r\n2 CONC before been kidnapped near Worcester Mass.  and carried into captivity by the redskins, with whom he remained for nearly2 years. It chanced  that during this time he was brought into the company of Ha\r\n2 CONC nnah Dustin and Mary Neff, the details of whose capture by the Indians at Haverhill, Mass., in 1697, had horrified all New England. The three, while in a wigwamoccupied by 2 Indian families on an isla\r\n2 CONC nd in the Merrimac river, nearConcord, planned their escape. The boy Samuel had been so long with the savages that, when he asked his master how to strike to kill instantly, and how to take a scalp, i\r\n2 CONC t was taken as a sign that he had become one of them, and he was freely told. When the  captives had perfected their plans, silently and with speed, while their captors slept, the attack was made. Ten\r\n2 CONC  Indians were killed instantly; the two remaining, a squaw who was wounded, and a child who was spared purposely, escaped to the woods. With the scalps of the slain and their weapons, the 3, captives \r\n2 CONC nolonger, embarked in a canoe, and having scuttled the boats that remained, descended the river until they came in safety to their friends. Thenews of their escape spread from settlement to settlement\r\n2 CONC , and all whoheard were filled with astonishment and admiration because of their heroic deed. Soon after the family of the boy Samuel, doubtless fearing thenand always the vengeance of his implacable \r\n2 CONC foes, fled in secrecy toPachaug, and became permanent settlers there. Family tradition alone tellsus that at one timein the early days the Leonards became aware ofan Indian lurking about their home. A\r\n2 CONC t last, after days of watching, amemberofthe family shot the Indian dead, seemingly with no morecompunction thanhe would have shown toward a dangerous beast. But such incidents wereexceptional.</p><p>\r\n2 CONC </p>"],

She is sometimes also misidentified as Alice Ayres, who was actually part of a different Howland family\r\n2 CONC  in Ely rather than the correct Howlands, of Fen Stanton. The Ely marriage was in 1600, much too late for the accepted ages of John and his brothers. These errors seem to have arisen when one Leon Cla\r\n2 CONC rk Hills discovered Howland marriage records in Ely, a discovery reported by Francis Stoddard in \"The Truth About the Pilgrims\". The Pligrim John Howland Society reexamined the record and concluded th\r\n2 CONC at the Ely and Fenstanton Howland families were separate. <p></p> <p> </p> <p>In 1964 the work of Sir Anthony Wagner was reported in The Howland</p> <p>Quarterly vol XXVIII nos. 2 & 3 (Jan-Apr 1964). \r\n2 CONC This article separates the Ely and Fen Stanton Howlands.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>born about 1567 in Essex, England.

    notes: ["<p>&nbsp;</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>When Herbert K. Sparrell returned to Worcester from the Civil War in 1864, he was still in his teens. He went to work for a local butcher/sausage maker and learned the\r\n2 CONC  trade. Through his work he became acquainted with a German beer & sausage saloonkeeper named Franz Josef Kerber. In 1871 they established a \"smoked meat shop\" under the name of Kerber & Sparrell cate\r\n2 CONC ring to the local German immigrant community. In 1872 Herbert married Louisa Katherine, one of the identical twin daughters of Franz. In August 1873, Franz died leaving Herbert and Louisa to run the s\r\n2 CONC hop. Louisa and Herbert extended credit to their customers, entering the sums due in a large ledger. In 1874 a financial panic occurred. Many customers lost their jobs and were unable to pay their bil\r\n2 CONC ls. The shop went under and the penniless couple was helped out by her extended family of German relatives.</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>Herbert found a job as a clerk in 1875, but by 1883 he had establishe\r\n2 CONC d abeer and sausage saloon catering to the German community. While runningthe saloon, Herbert met two brothers from Yorkshire who knew how to make good English ale but didn't know how to market it to \r\n2 CONC Americans.  (Inthose days, beer and ale were locally brewed and distributed in barrels to saloons. If you wanted beer, you drank ina saloon or took a tin container called a \"growler\" down to the saloo\r\n2 CONC n to be filled and broughthome.) Herbert offered to help the Bowler brothers sell their beer to the local saloons. Herbert turned out to be a fabulous salesman. Bowler Brothers became the largest brew\r\n2 CONC ery in Massachusetts. In 1891, Herbert'stitle was \"salesman\", by 1897 he was \"General Agent\" and by 1899, VicePresident. The Bowler brothers and H.K. Sparrell made fortunes and livedin grand style. Wh\r\n2 CONC en the Volstead Act outlawed beer in 1918, they wereold and rich so they just shut up shop and retired. Herbert K. left quite a bit of money to his children and grandchildren when he died in 1923.<p><\r\n2 CONC p></p></p><p><p>Bowler Brothers Brewery, Ltd. operated from 1883 - 1918 at the corner of Quinsigamond and  Ellsworth Streets in Worcester.</p></p><p><p></p></p><p>According to article in Worcester Dai\r\n2 CONC ly Spy, the reception for Emily Sparrell's (their daughter) wedding was held at their house at 6 Richards St, Worcester, MA</p>"],

    notes: ["James Avery, Jr., was deputy from New London to the general court of Connecticut, 1689, 1690, 1694, 1695, 1697, 1792.  He was deputy from Groton from 1707 to 1712 inclusive (after Groton was set off f\r\n2 CONC rom New London.)  He was commissioner of the peace, 1693, 1694, 1695.  He was made justice of the peace in 1712.  He was made advisor of the Pequots in 1694.  in 1720, he was made one of their guardia\r\n2 CONC ns, which office he held until his death;  the records show that he faithfully protected his wards in their lands and other rights.  In 1700, he was one of a committee to find lands for the volunteers\r\n2 CONC who had fought in the Naragansett war of1675.  That land is now known as Voluntown, Connecticut.  In 1690, hewas commissioned as lieutenant and in May, 1692, as captain of the trainband.  He and hiswi\r\n2 CONC fe were members of the New London First Church ofChrist.  In 1696, he with others petitioned the general court for permission to form a church on the east side of the river where he lived.  Thispetiti\r\n2 CONC on was not granted until 1704, when the territory east of theriverwas set off from New London and called Groton.  James Avery and his wife are first on the list of those in full communion in the Churc\r\n2 CONC h of Christ of Groton.  The above records, with the exception of his membershipin the church at Groton, are to be found in the Colonial Records published by the state of Connecticut. <p></p>"],

    notes: ["FROM \"LEONARD GENEALOGY\" <p>Has been called carpenter, husbandsman and planter.He lived in Bridgewater at the time of his marraige, having built a house on his fathers land--a common thing in those da\r\n2 CONC ys--having assurance that a title would be given at a future date. He became an early proprietor in Worcester, where his brother Jacob had been living several years and removed to that place before 16\r\n2 CONC 90 and was living there whenhis only son Samuel was taken captive by Indians in 1695. About this time he  seems to have removed to Norwich ,Conn.and bought land in Preston, Conn.on the opposite side o\r\n2 CONC f the Shetucket River. He was probably led to this place by the fact that some of Major Bradfords family had located here and several oldfriends and neighbors from Duxbury and Bridgewater. Among them \r\n2 CONC Josiah and Miles Standish( son ans grandson of renowned Capt. Miles Standish ofthe Mayflower) and Deacon Caleb Fobes. He was a consistent member of theFirst Church of Preston, formed 16 Nov.1698 when \r\n2 CONC Rev. Salmon Treat wasordained pastor. Mr. Treat resigned14March1744, and died 6Jan1762 aged90. <p>Second wife Deborah is thought to be the daughter of John Leonard of Springfield who were relatives.</\r\n2 CONC p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BOOK---GRISWOLD-A HISTORY       Being a history of the town of Grisw\r\n2 CONC old CTmicrofilm 1597788 item 5    book  975.65/G3   H2p    pp11,12,54 <p>SAMUEL LEONARD</p> <p>About 1696 there came to the Pachaug country Samuel Leonard, who with his family settled on the banks of \r\n2 CONC the Pachaug river, east of Appaquashosk hill. They had experienced to the full the savagery of the Indians, for their only son, a lad of 12 years, also named Samuel, had just before been kidnapped  an\r\n2 CONC d carried into captivity by the redskins, with whomhe remained for nearly 2 years. It chanced  that during this time he was brought into the company of Hannah Dustin and Mary Neff, the detailsof whose\r\n2 CONC  capture by the Indians at Haverhill, Mass., in 1697, had horrified all New England. The three,while in a wigwam occupied by 2 Indian families on an island in the Merrimac river, near Concord, planned\r\n2 CONC  theirescape. The boy Samuel had been so long with the savages that, whenhe asked his master how to strike to kill instantly, and how to take ascalp, it was taken as a sign that he had become one of t\r\n2 CONC hem, and he was freely told. When the  captives had perfected their plans, silently and with speed, while thier captors slept, the attack was made. Ten Indians were killed instantly; the two remaining\r\n2 CONC , a squaw who was wounded, and achild who was spared purposely, escaped to the woods. With thescalps ofthe slain and their weapons, the three, captives no longer, embarked ina canoe, and having scuttl\r\n2 CONC ed the boats that remained, descendedthe river until the came in safety to their friends. The news of theirescape spread from settlement to settlement, and all who heard were filled withastonishment a\r\n2 CONC nd admiration because of their heroic deed. Soon after theboy Samuel returned, doubtless fearing then and always the vengeanceofhis implacable foes, the family fled in secrecy to Pachaug,and becameper\r\n2 CONC manent settlers there. Family tradition alone tells us that at one timein the early days the Leonards became aware of an Indian lurkingabout their home. At last, after days of watching, a member of th\r\n2 CONC e family shoot the Indian dead, seemingly with no more compunction than he would have shown toward a dangerous beast. But such incidents were exceptional. <p></p>"],

Sparrell, the oldest child of Herbert and Louisa, graduated from \"Hinmans Business College\" in Worcester. Th\r\n2 CONC at is where he learned the beautiful copperplate script that you see in his letters. After school he went to work for the Wheelock Engine Company, and after four years he left to work for Norcross Bro\r\n2 CONC thers, a Worcester contractor who built monumental structures including the Boston Public Library, Custom House Tower and South Station. They built the Rhode Island Statehouse andnumerous Newport and \r\n2 CONC New York mansions. Norcross worked often with New York Architects McKim, Mead and White. Grampa Sparrell became a friend of Stanford White. Grampa Sparrell became General Paymaster and Auditor of Purc\r\n2 CONC hases and Accounts for Norcross.He would carry the pay in cash by train from Worcester to the various building sites. He practiced witha pistol until he could shoot rabbits on the run at 30 paces with\r\n2 CONC out ever missing. He was extremely proud of this skill and let it be known around the job sites. He always wore his 38-caliber revolver in plain sight when he traveled with the payrolls. In 1916, Norc\r\n2 CONC ross merged with a New York Company. Grampa was offered a job as paymaster in New York City but he refused to move. In 1917, he went to work for the Spencer Wire Company of Worcester. In 1932 Spencer \r\n2 CONC failed in the depression and he took a job selling Life Insurance for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. My father said selling life insurance was not an easy way to make money in the de\r\n2 CONC pression and many of his customers were old friends and acquaintances. They had to sell the Coolidge Road house because they couldn't afford to keep it up. Grandma Sparrell (\"Vinnie\") had a prolonged \r\n2 CONC bout with cancer and those bills left him destitute at her death. My father and Uncle Lester supported Grandpa Sparrell and Lester got him the job at the Bethlehem yard during the war. I know my fathe\r\n2 CONC r was annoyed that Grampa kept his apartment in Worcester throughout the war even though he was living in Boston. He felt that Grampa should have saved more of his money to live on when the war ended.\r\n2 CONC </p>"],

    notes: ["<p>JAMES NEWTON SPARRELL III and DESIRE BARRELL SPARRELL</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>James Newton Sparrell III was born May 8,1798 in the old South Parish of Scituate (set off as the town of South Scituate\r\n2 CONC  in 1848 and renamed Norwell in 1878). He was the  eldest of the seven children of James Newton Sparrell II and Rachel Turner Sparrell. James was born and grew up in a house no longer standing near th\r\n2 CONC e present SE corner of Bridge Street and Main Street in Norwell.</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>In 1820 James III is described as a \"cabinetmaker\" in a quitclaim deed executed by his father in a vain attempt \r\n2 CONC to shelter some of the real estate then being seized by his creditors in bankruptcy.  (Beautiful furniture made by James could be seen in the Sparrell house on Central Street up until the death in the\r\n2 CONC  1970?s of Grace,  Ernest Sparrell?s third wife). There is also a receipt for a coffin dated 1822 which is the basis for the Sparrell-MacNamara funeral home on Central to claim that theyare the oldest\r\n2 CONC  undertaker in Massachusetts. (the undertaking business was actually founded by James?s second son, Charles Warren on his returnfrom the Civil War.)</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>James III did all kinds of w\r\n2 CONC oodwork during his lifetime. He worked in the shipyards along the North River. He built houses, shingled the alms house, made wooden boxes, small boats and did whatever  carpentry work he could find. \r\n2 CONC He taught his trade to his sons and James IV, Charles W. and George H. were listed as \"housewrights\" before the Civil War.</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>James? largest project was the construction of the 2nd\r\n2 CONC  Parish Meeting House (now the Norwell Unitarian Church) in 1830. The church was designed by his younger brother, Boston Architect William Sparrell. According to family tradition,  a keg of rum was br\r\n2 CONC oached at the frame raising. James imbibed too much. James climbed to the top of the frame to drive the wooden pins that connected the joints. He then proceeded to dance along the twelve inch horizont\r\n2 CONC al beams 30 feet above the ground and refused to come down much to the embarrassment of his wife.</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>James married Desire Barrell in the 2nd Parish Meeting house on 6 October 1822.\r\n2 CONC  After their marriage, they  lived with her parents in her father?s house on Central Street. The house, barn and James woodworking shop are still standing. James? tools remained in the shop until the \r\n2 CONC 1960?s when Grace gave the tools to Old Sturbridge Village Museum.</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>James held a number of minor public offices in the town. He was on the Prudential (school) Committee 1828-1831\r\n2 CONC , Overseer of the Poor 1831, Sealer of Weights and Measures from 1826 to 1833, Surveyor ofLumber from 1838 to 1845, etc.</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>James died 1 Mar 1859 leaving his tools to Charles W. an\r\n2 CONC d the rest of his estate to Desire. He is buried in the cemetery by the church which he built and where he owned two pews.</p></p><p><p></p></p><p><p>Desire Barrell Sparrell was born in the South Pari\r\n2 CONC sh of Scituate on 6 Oct 1798. (There is some confusion about her birth date because she  wasgiven the same name, as was the custom then, of an older sister who haddied in infancy. Census and death rec\r\n2 CONC ords confirm her birth date.). Shewas the daughter of James Barrell, Jr. and his wife Martha Farrow Barrell.</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>In 1811, Scituate voted to establish an almshouse at the present cor\r\n2 CONC nerof Main and Central Streets in Norwell. James Barrell, Jr.  became thekeeper in 1818, serving until illness forced him to resign in 1829. In1820 James purchased a house on Central Street just down \r\n2 CONC the hill fromthealmshouse. Charles Warren Sparrell lived in the house all his lifeand inherited it when his mother died. The house remained in that branch of the family until the death of Grace Sparre\r\n2 CONC ll.</p><p><p></p></p><p><p>Desire assisted her husband and later her son Charles W. by sewing coffin liners and burial shroud" <> ...],

    notes: ["JAMES NEWTON SPARRELL II and RACHEL TURNER SPARRELL <p></p> <p>James Newton Sparrell II was born in Scituate, Massachusetts Bay Colonyon 7 April 1770. He was the second of three children of Captain Ja\r\n2 CONC mes Newton Sparrell and Ruth Vinal Sparrell. From March 1771 until 1778, Thefamily lived in a house that formerly stood by Scituate Harbor north ofthe present town pier. On 4 June 1775, James and his \r\n2 CONC sisters, Elizabethand Hannah were christened and his mother, Ruth admitted to membershipin the Scituate First Parish Meeting House. Ruth later married Capt.Joshua Jenkins, another sea captain, in the \r\n2 CONC same church on 24 December1778. <p></p> <p>After Ruth?s remarriage, the family moved to Captain Jenkin?s house on the Beaverdam Road site where the Clipper Ship Motel now stands. Joshua had been lost \r\n2 CONC at sea and one of James?s sisters had died by the time of the 1790 census which lists Ruth Jenkins as the head of family. By 1787,James Newton Sparrell had followed his father and stepfather to sea an\r\n2 CONC dby 1797 he was referred to as \"Captain Sparrell\". <p></p> <p>On 11 June 1797, James married Rachel Turner in the Second Parish Meeting House in the south end of Scituate (Now Norwell). On 8 July 1797\r\n2 CONC , James purchased three-quarters of  a dwelling house, three-quarters of a barn and 16-1/2 acres of land from Abijah and Mary Turner Otis (Rachel?ssister) and conveyed to Mary Otis three parcels of la\r\n2 CONC nd and half a dwelling. On the same date, the Otises conveyed to James five acres of saltmeadow by the North River and 3-1/2 acres of wood lot on Simon?s Hillset off as Mary?s portion of the estate of\r\n2 CONC  her father John Turner. On 8April 1799, James acquired additional property from Abijah and Mary including five acres of salt marsh on the North River and ¼ of a pew in theSecond Parish Meeting House\r\n2 CONC  also left to Mary by her father. Some ofthese transactions involved portions of the original land grant on theriveralloted in the 1630?s to Ruth?s ancestor and first settler Humphrey Turner. <p></p> \r\n2 CONC <p>James is referred to as \"Captain\" in Town Meeting Minutes (1801) and 2nd Parish Church Records (1810). He is recorded as a \"mariner\" in the 1797 land deeds. In deeds dated 1799 and 1802 he is recor\r\n2 CONC dedas \"yeoman\" and in deeds and other legal documents from March 1808 on he is titled \"gentleman\". (A yeoman was a small farmer who owned and worked his land.A gentleman was an owner of extensive prop\r\n2 CONC erty holdings who employed farm laborers to do the work.) James apparently retired from the sea after his marriage and settled ashore as a farmer. <p></p> <p>In 1805, James appears in the Plymouth cus\r\n2 CONC tom house register. He and others including Thatcher Tilden (his neighbor and husband of  Lucy Turner Tilden, Rachel?s sister)  are listed as owners of the 200 ton, three-masted full-rigged ship Flore\r\n2 CONC nzo of Scituate. <p></p> <p>On 29 May 1802, James purchased a 20 acre farm next to his farm from Samuel Foster. In August 1809 he acquired ( with Thomas Cushing) 4-3/4 acres of salt meadow between the\r\n2 CONC  third and fourth cliffs. From that pointon his land purchases were scattered and appear to be speculative investments. These included 50 acres of land between Colman?s Hills and thehighway (now Stock\r\n2 CONC bridge Road) and a house with 1-1/2 acres of land fromJ. Robert Northey ( March 1812). <p></p> <p>Between 1800 and 1817, James held a number of minor town offices and appointments. These included Surv\r\n2 CONC eyor of Highways (14 years), Constable, Hog Reeve, Moderator (1814 special town meeting), Methodist Society Inquiry Committee, Election Committee, Workhouse Inquiry Committee (1811), etc. The Methodis\r\n2 CONC t Committee reported that the society was not a menace to public order and should be allowed to establish a church. The Workhouse Committee recommended that the town meeting establish a home for orpha\r\n2 CONC ns, idiots, and the destitute elderly rather than to continue to auction them off to the lowest bidder ( The alms house was bu" <> ...],

He sayed in Wethersfield and Hartford for a few years but in 1649 was \r\n2 CONC in New London, Conn where he took up a house lot the next year.  His home in New London was on Post Hill near the north corner of Williams and Vauxhall Streets and he apparently died there about 1663 \r\n2 CONC at an advanced age.  Late in life on Feb25 1661/62 the following appears about him.  \" Old Goodman Comtstock (was elected sexton) to order youth in the meeting house and beat out dogs, at forty shilli\r\n2 CONC ngs a year, dig all graes and have 4 shilling for a grave for a man or woman and 2 shilling for children.\" <p></p> <p>after his death land inherited by son Daniel and grandson William of Lyme who was \r\n2 CONC son of John Comstock, deceased, and Abigail</p> <p></p> <p>Reference #2 states that the information that he is to have come from Wales is not true.
