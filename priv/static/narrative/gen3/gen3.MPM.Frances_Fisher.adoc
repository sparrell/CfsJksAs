= Frances Fisher

Born in 1835 (likely in Paris, Maine). Daughter of link:https://github.com/sparrell/CfsJksAs/blob/main/priv/static/adoc/V2_C5_G4/gen4.MPMP.Albert_Fisher.adoc[Albert Fisher] and link:https://github.com/sparrell/CfsJksAs/blob/main/priv/static/adoc/V2_C5_G4/gen4.MPMM.Arvilla_Gray.adoc[Arvilla Gray].

Traditionally, Frances Fisher was integrated into the family tree as the daughter of Albert Fisher (1812-1887) and Arvilla Gray (1808-1888) and older sister to Albert AF Fisher (1854-1915). Subsequent research questions the accuracy of this arrangement. 
Thanks to the work of Certified Genealogist Polly FitzGerald Kimmitt, there is sufficient evidence to acknowledge the possibility that Frances Fisher was, in fact, Albert AF Fisher’s mother.
